    <p>Most of the House's events - from concerts to theatrical performances - are run by volunteer forces. The philosophy of the house is that culture is something we create together. Therefore, you can also volunteer in several ways, depending on your interests.<br><br>

        You can become part of:
        House Volunteer Team
        Bastard café game guru
        Volunteer in the Theater HOUSE
        Volunteer in the House Cinema<br>
<br>

        In this way, it is possible to grow one's inner nerd and at the same time gain insight into what it is like to be part of a large and vibrant cultural center with lots of different niche areas.<br><br>



        What kind of volunteer are you?<br><br>


        House Volunteers: As a volunteer in the House, you come around on all the stages and participate in a lot of different events. Some guards may come to hear jazz, other times it is a theater performance, or you may need to help out at an evening of stand-up or poetry slam. The house volunteer team is a really good place to start if you want to try it all. If that sounds like something to you, write to: frivillig@huset-kbh.dk<br><br>



        Bastard Café game guru: Do you read game manuals in your spare time? Do you meet with your friends and spend five hours on a Sunday afternoon on board games? Then you might want to be part of the Bastard Café's volunteer team, which consists of game gurus who are ready to help as guests in the café throw themselves over a new game they haven't tried before. Here it is a voluntary job with lots of socializing both with the other game gurus and of course the guests as well. If that sounds like something to you, write to: guru@bastardcafe.dk


        <br><br>
        Volunteer in the House Cinema: The House Cinema is an old underground cinema that shows alternative films and specializes in creative film screenings. The house's cinema also offers lots of kitsch feature films, musical sing-along, forgotten classics, hidden treasures and overlooked masterpieces. As a volunteer at Huset Cinema you will be responsible for ticket sales, settlement (with an analogue film viewer!) PR, bar, etc. - and you become part of a social community that just LOVES movies. If that sounds like something to you, write to: jack.stevenson@mail.dk
        <br><br>


        Volunteer in the Theater House : The Theater House is the House Theater Association. Here you will find all layers of high-level performing arts - from idea to production. The association has gathered scenes, courses, workshops and rehearsal rooms under one roof. In doing so, it has created a meeting place for the Danish theater environment and provides the framework for the growth team. As a volunteer, you can help out at the Vox and Xenon scenes or at the Teaterfestivallen Vildskud, held every year in August. If this sounds like something to you, write to: projekt@teater-huset.dk. </p>
