        <h1>What is Huset-KBH?</h1>
    </center>
    <p>In the House you will find a lot of cultural experiences, curly ideas and creative flavors. With no less than 5 scenes, a cinema, a theater, rehearsal rooms, food stalls, arcade games, a board game cafe - and more than twenty associations and clubs - a lot is happening!
        <br><br>
        The house is actually one of Denmark's oldest cultural houses! It has been located in Magstræde in the middle of Copenhagen since 1970, where it was occupied by a group of hippies and artists.<br><br>

        In 2015, the House became part of DIT: KBH, which consists of the cultural houses Huset-KBH, the World Cultural Center, Onkel Dannys Plads, Kulturhuset Indre By and also houses the organizations CPH Volunteers and Project Pioneers. In total, DIT: KBH stands for more than 3,000 annual cultural events and offers, which brings together over 1.2 million. visitors to Copenhagen every year.<br><br>

        Although today the house has changed its name and officially now called Huset-KBH, the old Magstræde spirit lives on through play, creativity and volunteerism. The house is about creating fun, fun and alternative cultural experiences that make everyday life stand out!</p>
